# Vaccine Prioritization

## Overview

Guided by the belief that every life has equal value, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation works to help all people lead healthy, productive lives.

This project is a step towards that aim. We use suitable technologies and methodologies to make informed decisions so that the vaccines reach the communities faster and at lower cost.

## Data

Historical and forecasted values for population, vaccine coverage and cases averted rate is provided for 74 GAVI classified countries.

The information is provided from IHME and WHO sources. A decision to choose the data from these two sources is made after thorough analysis and results.


## Tools and Technologies
* R
* Excel
* Arima model for forecasting

The final methodology used to prioritize the vaccine distribution is explained in the presentation.

An Excel dashboard is created to facilitate the users with filtering the data and find the prioritized countries and vaccines.
